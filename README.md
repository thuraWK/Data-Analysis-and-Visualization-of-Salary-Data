In this project, I built a Python program to analyze and visualize individuals' age and salary data. 
Using Pandas, I organized the data in a DataFrame, calculated average age and salary, and displayed these insights. 
I then used Matplotlib to create a color-coded bar chart of salaries for easy comparison. 
This project highlights data analysis, statistical calculation, and clear data visualization with Python.
